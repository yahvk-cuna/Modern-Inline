# Modern Inline

A compatible mod for Modern UI and Inline.

Modern UI's text rendering engine is incompatible with Inline.
This mod will make text rendering use Modern UI by default, and fall back to the vanilla text rendering engine (which has been injected by Inline) when Inline data is present.

Note: This mod uses a relatively simple method and has not been fully tested. It may be unstable or cause the game to crash.
